  d. Retail (provide Retailer vendor code)  

SOP:

Our procedure is straight for PO/CI/Payment/Logistics. 

Commission:

There are no restrictions on commissions. We give price to you, 
you sell at what you can. We don't restrict. For customers who 
chose to disclose their selling price to us, we will never 
increase our price. For example a customer sold inventory he 
bought from us at 28.50 to one end customer and 27.50 to another, 
we kept our price the same through out. We don't care what our 
customer margins are to keep this simple.

Pricing Policy:

If there is any restrictions, it is no selling below a certain 
price and that price is usually below the buy price so we haven't 
had any issues on this. For example Evolve are not allowed to be 
sold below $240, nobody has sold below that.
