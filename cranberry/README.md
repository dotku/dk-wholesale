## Qulification

The 4 qualified end customers for Evolve are

  a. GPO (provide GPO vendor code)  
  b. Healthcare Facility (provide NIH code)  
  c. Government (provide CAGE code and SAMS contract #)  
  d. Retail (provide Retailer vendor code)  

## SOP

Our procedure is straight for PO/CI/Payment/Logistics. 

## Commission

There are no restrictions on commissions. We give price to you, 
you sell at what you can. We don't restrict. For customers who 
chose to disclose their selling price to us, we will never 
increase our price. For example a customer sold inventory he 
bought from us at $28.50 to one end customer and $27.50 to another, 
we kept our price the same through out. We don't care what our 
customer margins are to keep this simple.

## Pricing Policy

If there is any restrictions, it is no selling below a certain 
price and that price is usually below the buy price so we haven't 
had any issues on this. For example Evolve are not allowed to be 
sold below $240, nobody has sold below that.
